Same as original, but

* Rewrited with es6, respecting airbnb style
* Using Rollup to produce UMD version
* Tested with Ava
* Applied some corrections
* Published as **accounting-js** on NPM

**accounting.js** is a tiny JavaScript library for number, money and currency parsing/formatting. It's lightweight, fully localisable, has no dependencies, and works great client-side or server-side. Use standalone or as a nodeJS/npm and AMD/requireJS module.

### Works great with:

* **[money.js](http://openexchangerates.github.com/money.js "JavaScript and NodeJS Currency Conversion Library")** - a tiny (1kb) standalone JavaScript currency conversion library, for web & nodeJS
* **[Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org "realtime and historical exchange rates/currency conversion data API")** - the free currency conversion data API
